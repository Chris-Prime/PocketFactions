# PocketFactions
A full-featured Factions plugin for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP).

# What works?

* Creating factions
* Changing faction description

I put a ton of work into this to make it as close to [PC Factions](https://github.com/MassiveCraft/Factions) (The old version, not the s**t new one).
So please, give the repo a star.

## TODO
See [#1](https://github.com/TheDiamondYT1/PocketFactions/issues/1)
